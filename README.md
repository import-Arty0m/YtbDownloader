# YtbDownloader
 A tool to extract audio from ytb links !

If you have any problems due to the use of this program(not linked to the proper work of the code), I'm not able to help you and I won't face the problems for you !


Librairies needed if you use your own python environment:
                                                    -Ctk
                                                    -Tk
                                                    -Yt_dlp
                                                    -PILLOW

If you use a software like vscode be carefull to select the good python interpreter ! In this case it's located in Project_file/venv/Scripts/python.exe

You need to download all the files that is in the gitHub repository. If you miss one of them the code will not work.
